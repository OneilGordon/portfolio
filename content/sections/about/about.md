The field of software development has allowed me to fuse my love of technology (and all things nerdy) with a need to create, and have those creations be impactful to others. Through channelling this passion, Iâ€™ve built <u>industry focused applications</u>, worked in a startup and provided <u>consulting and development</u> for freelance clients.

My time in university was spent studying <u>mathematics and computer science</u>. These years honed my <u>problem solving</u> skill set, allowed me to develop an acute attention to detail and additionally acquire a great deal of technical skill. Most importantly, I <u>learned how to learn.</u> If I am not familiar with a topic or specialty area, I posses the proven ability to reach proficiency in a short amount of time.

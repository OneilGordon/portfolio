I'm a Full Stack Developer who's been building industry utilized applications since my second year of college. Since then, I've worked in startups, founded a couple myself, and taken on freelance projects and consulting for clients.

My educational background in mathematics and computer science has provided me with an acute attention to detail, a great deal of technical skill, and vast problem solving experience. The rigorous university degree program has allowed me to develop an excellent learning skill set. 

If I am not familiar with a topic or specialty area, I possess the ability and training to become proficient with it very quickly.
